# Iambic Pentameter Checker
### This project is for TechTogether Online, the digital hackathon hosted by MLH on Aug 4 - 6, 2023.
Created by [Isabel Abonitalla](https://github.com/isabiiil)

In an attempt to win Github's creative use challenge, I wanted to make all my commit messages into iambic pentameter. I figured imitating Shakespeare was a creative use of the version control platform. But I couldn't find anything to check my rhymes and stressed syllables and rhythmic pattern, so I decided to make that this weekend. I hope to gain octocat stickers while practicing string manipulation and API integration. 

Here's what I need to check for to confirm that it is in iambic pentameter. 
+ ten syllables per line, only two lines
+ alternating stressed syllables (unstressed-stressed makes one iambic foot)
+ optional ending rhyme

Please check [my commit messages](https://github.com/isabiiil/tto-hack/commits/main) to see all my little sonnets. Most of them only check for the first criteria above, though that's a reflection of my literary skill not programming. Feel free to try your hand at creating your own iambic pentameter sonnets here.

This project uses:
+ Next.js (including TailwindCSS)
+ Merriam-Webster API
